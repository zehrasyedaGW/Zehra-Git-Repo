Discuss why a salted hash is important when storing sensitive data such as passwords.\n","B. Explore a python library for Zero Knowledge Proofs and propose how this might improve authentication.

Rainbow table reverses cryptographic hash functions.\n","2. If 2 users have same password their hashes will also be same and adding salt makes each unique. Therefore, harder to crack.\n","3. Salting forces attackers to compute hash for each password individually, increasing the workload on the attacker and making large scale attacks effort intensive. Even if attacker has hash algorhithm, the salt makes each password unique, forcing the attacker to figure it out individually.\n","\n","Sources:\n","a. https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html\n","\n","Answer B:\n","Zero Knowledge Proofs allow one party to prove to another that they know a value, like a password, without revealing any information about the value itself.\n","\n","Python Library Example:\n","a. py_ecc and pyzksnark: Implements elliptic curve operations, which are foundational for many ZKP protocols.\n","b. pyzksnark: A Python binding for zkSNARKs, a popular ZKP protocol.\n","\n","Traditional authentication requires the user to send a password or a hash to the server, which can be intercepted or leaked. With ZKP-based authentication, the user can prove they know the password without ever sending it or its hash to the server. This means, even if the communication is intercepted, the attacker learns nothing about the password.The server does not need to store password hashes, reducing the risk if the server is compromised.Replay attacks are prevented, as each proof is unique and cannot be reused.\n","\n","Sources:\n","a. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rO1NB9TD4iUZ3qghGEGtqNX\n"],"metadata":{"id":"fp-2qz411SsY"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Part 8\n","Name one AES encryption mode that requires an Initial Vector (IV) and explain why it is considered more secure than other modes.  \n","\n","One common AES encryption mode that requires an Initialization Vector is Cipher Block Chaining mode.\n","The reason CBC is more secure is because it prevents pattern decoding or recognition. In Electronic Codebook mode, identical plaintext blocks always produce identical ciphertext blocks, which can reveal patterns in the data. In CBC mode, each plaintext block is stored with the previous ciphertext block before encryption. The first block uses the IV instead of a previous ciphertext block.The IV ensures that even if the same plaintext is encrypted multiple times with the same key, the ciphertext will be different each time (as long as the IV is unique and random). This randomizes the block making it harder to decode. This randomness prevents attackers from deducing information about the plaintext from repeated ciphertext patterns.\n","\n","Sources:\n","a. https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-38a.pdf"],"metadata":{"id":"PNZDbD2l4jh-"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Part 9\n","\n","Name one AES encryption mode that does not require an IV.  \n","\n","\n","One AES encryption mode that does not require an Initialization Vector is Electronic Codebook mode.
