Curiosity is the cornerstone of innovation in technology leadership. I believe in the power of continuous learning and a hands on approach – “learning by doing” - to stay ahead in a rapidly evolving landscape. This repository reflects my ongoing exploration at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity, where I experiment with and build machine learning solutions, aimed at enhancing security architecture (applying relevant framework including Did, ZTA, ASA and more), enhancing threat detection, automating response mechanisms, and improving overall security posture. Each mini project here is a step toward understanding how AI can be practically applied to real world cybersecurity challenges, bridging theory with impact.
I welcome your feedback, input and ideas on how to further enhance and improve the approach and thinking across each project. Lets collaborate!
